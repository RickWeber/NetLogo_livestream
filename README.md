# NetLogo_livestream
Sharing code for livestreaming NetLogo coding sessions.

As of right now I've been working on the Spread of Disease model from 
NetLogo's model library. As I do more, I'll better organize things.

If you haven't already, you should check out NetLogo. Complexity Explorer has a great MOOC to learn about Agent Based Modeling.
